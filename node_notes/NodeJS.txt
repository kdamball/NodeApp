Querying & File Reading:
	Streaming API with files as if they were network streams. You cant read/write from a specific point however. For that
	you use filesystem itself. 
	
	Normalizing Path:
		normalizing path from users or as a result of joining two paths. Useful usually before storing files
		eg: var path = require('path');
				path.normalize('/foo/bar//baz/asdf/quux/..');   // => '/foo/bar/baz/asdf'
	
	Joining Paths:
		Using "path.join()"
		eg: var path = require('path');
				path.join('/foo', 'bar', 'baz/asdf', 'quux', '..');  // => '/foo/bar/baz/asdf'
